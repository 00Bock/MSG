1. The name of the tables to check:
	tbLoggedentities
	tbLogTimeValues
	
2. To limit the number of records to retrieve, use the following command:

	SELECT TOP 500 * FROM dbo.tbLoggedEntities
	SELECT TOP 500 * FROM dbo.tbLogTimeValues
	
	The data can be exported in CSV format, but in order to open it in Excel, the first two characters have to be changed to id (lowercase)...
	Also, change its extension to .txt
	
3. To count how many records are there in the table:
	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbo.tbLoggedEntities -> 598
	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbo.tbLogTimeValues -> as 8.4.2014: 178157194
	
	In tbLoggedEntities are stored the parameters of each measurement. The real values are stored in tbLogTimeValues. 
	
4. To count the records from a column (variable) from the database use the following syntax:
	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbo.tbLogTimeValues
	WHERE ParentID=440 (/MicroSmartGrid/Modbus Interface/Schnittstelle 21 (HauptzÃ¤hler)/Wirkleistung_Extended Trend Log)
	(result as 08.04.2014 = 1374799)
	
5. To see the max and min value of the column time (to determine the range of data) use:
